This code was used for a thesis project in I.Kant Russian State University. It uses parallel Pollard's rho-method to solve ECDLP problem.
The project includes:
  * field arithmetic;
  * big intereger arithmetic;
  * elliptic curve point arithmetic;
  * some classes for crypting and decrypting data;
  * some classes for parallel Pollard's method.

MPI 2 library was used for parallelization.
